1.f.
1.f.1.
project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to
identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain
works in creating the project gutenberg-tm collection. despite these
efforts, project gutenberg-tm electronic works, and the medium on which they
may be stored, may contain "defects," such as, but not limited to,
incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright
or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk
or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot
be read by your equipment.
1.f.2.
limited warranty, disclaimer of damages — except for the "right of
replacement or refund" described in paragraph 1.f.3, the project gutenberg
literary archive foundation, the owner of the project gutenberg-tm
trademark, and any other party distributing a project gutenberg-tm
electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for
damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. you agree that you have
no remedies for negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty or breach
of contract except those provided in paragraph f3. you agree that the
foundation, the trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement
will not be liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential,
punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility
of such damage.
1.f.3.
limited right of replacement or refund — if you discover a defect in this
electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund
of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to

physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.

to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. if you received the
work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose

lieu of a refund. if the second copy is also defective, you may demand a
refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.

the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state
law. the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement
shall not void the remaining provisions.

project gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and

section  2.
information about the mission of project gutenberg-tm
project gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. it exists because of the
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
of life.
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
they need, is critical to reaching project gutenberg-tm’s goals and ensuring
that the project gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. in 2001, the project gutenberg literary archive
foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
project gutenberg-tm and future generations. to learn more about the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation and how your efforts and donations
can help, see sections 3 and 4 and the foundation web page at
http://www.pglaf.org.

section 4.
information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive
foundation
project gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs.
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states.
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. to send donations or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate
while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with offers to donate.
international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
united states. u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods
and addresses. donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
checks, online payments and credit card donations. to donate, please
visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate
section 5.
general information about project gutenberg-tm electronic works.
professor michael s. hart is the originator of the project gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. for thirty years, he produced and distributed project gutenberg-tm
ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
project gutenberg-tm ebooks are often created from several printed editions,
all of which are confirmed as public domain in the u.s. unless a copyright
notice is included. thus, we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance
with any particular paper edition.
each ebook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the ebook’s ebook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ascii, compressed
(zipped), html and others.
corrected _editions_ of our ebooks replace the old file and take over the
old filename and etext number. the replaced older file is renamed.
_versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new ebooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.
most people start at our web site which has the main pg search facility:
http://www.gutenberg.org
this web site includes information about project gutenberg-tm, including how
to make donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation,
how to help produce our new ebooks, and how to subscribe to our email
newsletter to hear about new ebooks.
