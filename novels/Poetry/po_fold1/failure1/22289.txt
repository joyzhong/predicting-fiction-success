unusual letters or letterforms
capital u/v is shown as "v" for consistency, although the letterform
is closer to "u". thorn [th] appears several times at the beginning of
lines, and once in an abbreviation; "th" is used everywhere else.
a series of lines on page a.iiii. verso, starting with "ye neyther
loue me nor my iustyce fere", have initial lower-case "y". the first
of these may have been necessary to avoid collision with the [th] of
theprevious line.
in verse, nasal abbreviations such as [an] and [en] appear only in
lines with large initial drop caps. other abbreviations--mainly in the
latin passages--are shown in brackets:  [qui], [christi]. the word
shown as [thou] was printed as "u" directly above "thorn" (not "y").
