without resystence of grete impedyment
of all nygromancy / and fals enchauntement

made by the craft of many a nacyon
for to dystroye me / with strokes peryllous
to lette my iournaye / as i make relacyon
peryllous was the waye / and the cytuacyon
full gladde was i of the vertu of this glasse
whiche shewed me / what daungers i sholde passe

nor by the mouthe for i am not fyxte
for to be swalowed by erthly experyence
nor yet by felynge or touchynge exystence
my power dyuyne can not be palpable
for i myselfe am no thynge manyable

as in the lykenesse of a doue vnto chryste ihesu
at his baptysme i dyde it with good countenaunce
to shewe our godhed to be hygh and true
and at his transfyguracyon our power to ensue

or elles calke with deuylles the trouth to sertyfy
whiche contrary be to all true saynge

nor make hym blody / with woundes rufull
for he there strength / may ryghtfully reuerce
yet moreouer / as i do well reherce
this ryall shelde / in what place it be borne
shall soone be wonne / and shall not be forlorne
these thynges sene / to the thyrde myroure clere
i went anone / and in it loked ryght ofte
where in my syght / dyde wonderly appere
the fyrmament / with the sonne all alofte
the wynde not grete / but blowynge fayre and softe
and besyde the sonne / i sawe a meruaylous sterre
with beames twayne / the whiche were cast aferre
the one turnynge towarde the sterre agayne
the other stretched ryght towarde phebus
to beholde this sterre / i was somwhat fayne
but than i mused with herte full dolorous
whyder it sygnyfyed thynges good or peryllous
thus longe i studyed / tyll at the last i thought
what it sholde meane / as in my herte i sought
this sterre it sygnyfyeth the resynge of a knyght
the bowynge beame agayne so tournynge
betokened rattonnes of them whiche by myght
wolde hym resyst by theyr wronge resystynge
the beame towarde phebus clerely shynynge
betokened many meruaylous fyres grete
on them to lyght that wolde his purpose lete
in the fyre clerest of euery element
god hath appered vnto many a one
inspyrynge them / with grete wytte refulgent
who lyst to rede many dayes agone
many one wryteth trouthe / yet c[om]forte hath he none
wherfore i fere me / lyke a swarme of bees
wylde fyre wyll lyght amonge a thousande pees
[p] sepe expugnauerunt me a iuuentute mea:
et enim non potuerunt michi.
as the cantycles maketh good mencyon
they haue oft expugned me / syth my yonge age
yet coude they haue me / in theyr domynyon
though many a one / vnhappely do rage
they shall haue sorowe that shytte me in a cage
in a grete dyspyte of the holy goost
he maye them brenne / theyr calkynge is but loost
[p] supra dorsum me[um] fabricauer[un]t peccatores:

vpon my backe synners hath fabrysed
they haue prolonged theyr grete inyquyte
from daye to daye it is not my mynysshed
wherfore for vengeaunce by grete extremyte
it cryeth aboue / now vnto the deyte
whiche that his mynysters haue suffred so longe
to lyue in synne and euyll wayes wronge
whan i had perceyued euery maner thynge
of this ryall myrour / accordynge to effecte
remembrynge the verses / of the olde saynge
whiche in my mynde i dyde well coniecte
than to the swerde / i thought to haue respecte
ryght so i went / than at all auenture
vnto the hande / that helde the swerde so sure
i felte the hande / of the stell so fyne
me thought it quaked / the fyngers gan to stretche
i thought by that / i came than of the lyne
of the grete lady / that fyrst the swerde dyde fetche
the swerdes pomell / i began to ketche
the hande swerued / but yet neuer the lesse
i helde them bothe / by excellent prowes
{an}d at the last / i felte the hande departe
the swerde i toke / with all my besynesse
so i subdued / all the magykes arte
and founde the scauberde / of meruaylous rychesse
after that i toke the shelde doune doubtlesse
kyssynge the swerde / and the shelde ofte i wys
thankynge god / the whiche was cause of this
gladde was i than / of my ryall floure
of my swerde and shelde / i reioyced also
it pacyfyed well / my inwarde doloure
but fro my ladyes beaute / my mynde myght not go
i loued her surely / for i loued no mo
thus my fayre floure / and my swerde and shelde
with eyen ryght meke / full often i behelde

i trust now shortly / my lady for to se

where is my conforte / where is my lady fayre
where is my ioye / where is now all my boote
where is she nowe / that persed my herte rote
this maye i saye / vnto my owne dere loue
my goodly lady / fayrest and moost swete
in all my bokes / fayre fortune doth moue
for a place of grace / where that we sholde mete
also my bokes full pryuely you grete
the effectes therof / dooth well dayly ensue
by meruelous thynges / to proue them to be true
the more my payne / the more my loue encreaseth

the more i suffre / the lesse the fyre releasheth
the more i complayne the more is my smarte
the more i se her / the sharper is the darte
the more i wryte / the more my teeres dystyll
the more i loue / the hotter is my wyll
o moost fayre lady / yonge / good / and vertuous
i knewe full well / neuer your countenaunce
shewed me ony token / to make me amerous
but what for that / your prudent gouernaunce
hath enrached my herte / for to gyue attendaunce
your excellent beaute / you coude no thynge lette
to cause my herte vpon you to be sette
my ryght fayre lady / yf at the chesse i drawe
my selfe i knowe not / as a cheke frome a mate
but god aboue the whiche sholde haue in awe
by drede truely euery true estate
he maye take vengeaunce / though he tary late
he knoweth my mynde / he knoweth my remedy
he maye reuenge me / he knoweth my ieoperdy
o thou fayre fortune / torne not fro me thy face
remembre my sorowe / for my goodly lady
my tendre herte / she dooth full oft enbrace
and as of that it is no wonder why
for vpon her is all my desteny
submyttynge me / vnto her gracyous wyll
me for to saue or sodaynly to spyll
o ryght fayre lady of grene flourynge age
you can not do but as your frendes agre
your wyte is grete / you mekenes / dooth not swage
exyle dysdayne / and be ruled by pety
the frenshe man sayth / that shall be shall be
yf that i dye / louer was neuer none
deyed in this worlde / for a fayrer persone
your beaute causeth all my amyte
why sholde your beaute / to my dethe condyscende
your vertue and mekenes / dyde so arest me
why sholde ye than to dame dysdayne intende
your prudence your goodnes / dooth mercy extende
why sholde ye than enclyne to cruelte
your grace i trust wyll non extremyte
a dere herte i maye complayne ryght longe
you here me not / nor se me not arayed
nor causes my paynes for to be stronge
it was myn eyes / that made me fyrst dysmayde
with stroke of loue / that coude not me delaye
my ryght fayre lady / my herte is colde and faynt
wolde now to god / that you knewe my complaynte
thus as i mourned i herde a lady speke
i loked asyde i sawe my lady gracyous
my herte than fared / as it sholde breke
for perfyte ioye whiche was solacyous
before her grace / ryght swete and precyous
i kneled doune / saynge with all mekenesse
please it your grace / & excellent noblenes
no dyspleasure to take for my beynge here
for fortune me brought / to this place ryall
where i haue wonne this floure so vertuous & dere
this swerde and shelde / also not peregall
towadre hym aduenture to be tryumphall
and now by fortunes desteny and fate
do here my duety vnto your hygh estate
ihesu sayd she than / who hadde wende to fynde
your selfe walkynge / in this place all alone
full lytell thought i / ye were not in my mynde
what is the cause / that ye make suche mone
i thynke some thynge / be from you past and gone
but i wonder / how that ye dyde attayne
this floure / this swerde / the shelde also certayne
for by a lady in the antyquyte
they were made to a meruaylous entente
that none sholde get them / but by auctoryte
whiche onely by fortune / sholde hyder be sent
full many knyghtes by entendement
hath them aduentred / to haue them in dede
but all was vayne / for they myght neuer spede
wherfore surely / ye are moche fortunate
them for to wynne by your aduenture
but it was no thynge to you ordynate
and you dyde well / to put your selfe in vre
to proue the ieoperdy / whiche hath made you sure
leue all your mournynge / for there is no wyght
hath greter cause / for to be gladde and lyght
i behelde well her demure countenaunce
vnto her swete wordes / gyuynge good audyence
and than i marked in my remembraunce
her pleasaunt apparayle / with all my dylygence
whiche was full ryche of meruaylous excellence
fyrst alofte her forheed / full properly was dressed
vnder her orellettes / her golden heere well tressed
about her necke whyte as ony lyly
a prety chayne of the fynest golde
some lynkes with grene enameled truely
and some were blacke / the whiche i dyde beholde
the vaynes blewe / in her fayre necke well tolde
with her swete vysage tydynges to my herte
that sodynly my thoughtes were asterte
her gowne was golde / of the clothe of tyssewe
with armyns poudred / and wyde sleues pendaunt
her kyrtell grene of the fyne satyn newe
to bere her longe trayne / was well attendaunt
gentyll dame dylygence / neuer varyaunt
than as touchynge her noble stature
i thynke there can be / no goodlyer creature
as of her aege / so tendre and grene
fayre / gracyous / prudent / and louynge humylyte
her vertue shyneth / beynge bryght and shene
in her is nether pryde ne sybtylte
her gentyll herte / enclyneth to bounte
thus beaute / godlynesse / vertue / grace / and wytte
with bounte and mekenesse / in this lady is knytte
[p] amour.
thus whan my eyes hadde beholde her wele
madame i sayd how may i now be gladde
but sygh and sorowe with herte euery dele
longe haue i loued / and lytell conforte hadde
wherfore no wonder though that i be sadde
your tendre age / full lytell knoweth ywys
to loue vnloued / what wofull payne it is
[p] pucell.
{tho}ughe that i be yonge / yet i haue perceuera[un]ce
{th}at ther is no lady / yf that she gentyll be
{and} ye haue with her ony acquayntaunce
and after cast / to her your amyte
grounded on honoure / without duplycyte
i wolde thynke in mynde / she wolde condescende
to graunt your fauoure / yf ye none yll intende
[p] amour.
a fayre lady i haue vnto her spoken
that i loue best / and she dooth not it knowe
though vnto her / i haue my mynde broken
her beaute clere / dooth my herte ouerthrowe
whan i do se her / my herte booth sobbe i trowe
wherfore fayre lady / all dysparate of conforte
i speke vnknowen / i must to wo resorte
[p] pucell.
me thynke ye speke / now vnder parable
do ye se her here / whiche is cause of your grefe
yf ye so dyde / that sholde i be able
as in this cause / te be to your relefe
ryght lothe i were to se your myschefe
for ye knowe well / what case that i am yn
peryllous it wolde be / or that ye coude me wyne
[p] amour.
madame sayd i / thoughe myn eyes se her not
made dymme [with] wepynde / & with grete wo togyder
yet dooth myn herte / at this tyme i wote
her excellent beaute / ryght inwardly concyder
good fortune i trust / hath now brought me hyder
to se your mekenes / whiche doth her rapyre
whose swete conforte / dooth kepe me fro dyspayre.
[p] pucell.
of late i sawe aboke of your makynge
called the pastyme of pleasure / whiche is w[on]d{erous}
for i thynge and you had not ben in louynge
ye coude neuer haue made it so sentencyo{us}
i redde there all your passage daungerous
wherfore i wene for the fayre ladyes sake
that ye dyd loue / ye dyde that boke so make
[p] amour.
forsothe madame / i dyde compyle that boke
as the holy goost / i call vnto wytnes
but ygnorauntly / who so lyst to loke
many meruelous thynges in it / i do expresse
my lyue and loue / to enserche well doublesse
many a one doth wryte / i knowe not what in dede
yet the effecte dooth folowe / the trouthe for to spede
[p] pucell.
i graunt you well / all that whiche you saye
but tell me who it is / that ye loue so sure
i promyse you that i wyll not bewraye
her name truely to ony creature
pyte it is / you sholde suche wo endure
i do perceyue / she is not ryght ferre hence
whiche that ye loue / withouten neclygence
[p] amour.
surely madame / syth it pleaseth your hyghnesse
and your honour to speke so nobly
it is your grace / that hath the intresse
in my true herte / with loue so feruently
ryght longe ago / your beaute sodanly
entred my mynde / and hath not syth dekayde
with feruent loue / moost wofully arayde
[p] pucell.
{a}nd is it i / that is cause of your loue
{y}f it so be i can not helpe your payne
it sholde be harde / to gete to your aboue
me for to loue / i dyde not you constrayne
{y}e knowe what i am / i knowe not you certayne
i am as past your loue to specyfy
why wyll ye loue where is no remedy
[p] amour.
a madame you are cause of my languysshe
ye maye me helpe / yf that it to you please
to haue my purpose / my herte dooth not menysshe
thoughe i was seke / ye knewe not my dysease
i am not hole / your mercy maye me ease
to proue what i am / the holy goost werke styll
my lyfe and deth / i yelde nowe to your wyll
[p] pucell.
fortune me thynke / is meruaylous fauorable
to you by getynge / of this ryall floure
hauynge this swerde / and shelde so profytable
in mortall daungers / to be your socoure
but as touchynge your loue and fauoure
i can not graunt / neyther fyrst ne last
ye knowe what i am / ye knowe my loue is past
[p] amour.
madame the floure / the swerde and shelde also
whiche fortune gate me / are not halfe so dere
as your persone the cause of my wo
whose grace and beaute / shyneth so ryght clere
that in my herte your beaute doth appere
nothynge is past / but that fortunes pleasure
may call it agayne / in the tyme future
[p] pucell.
i denye not but that your dedes do shewe
by meruaylous prowes / truely your gentylnesse
to make you a carter / there were not afewe
but tho by crafte / whiche thought you to oppresse
to accombre them selfe applye the besynesse
yet thynke not you / so soone to se a cradle
i graunt you loue / whan ye were golden sadle
[p] amour.
madame truely / it is oft dayly sene
many a one dooth trust / his fortune to take
from an other man / to make hym blynde i wene
whiche blyndeth hym / and dooth his pompe aslake
often some hye / do fall alowe and quake
ryght so maye they / whiche dyde fyrst prepence
my wo and payne for all theyr yll scyence
[p] pucell.
to loue me so / whiche knoweth my persone
and my frendes eke / me thynke ye are not wyse
as now of me conforte haue ye none
wherefore this answere / maye to you suffyse
i can not do / but as my frendes deuyse
i can no thynge do / but as they accorde
they haue me promest / to a myghty lorde
[p] amour.
madame in this worlde ben but thynges twayne
as loue and hate / ye knowe your selfe the trouthe
yf i sholde hate you / deth i were worthy playne
than had you cause / with me to be wrothe
to deserue dyspleasure / my herte wolde be lothe
wherfore fayre lady / i yelde at this hower
to your mekenes / my herte my loue and power
[p] pucell.
{i} thynke you past all chyldy ygnoraunce
{but} gladde i am / yf prudence be your guyde
{gr}ace cometh often after gouernaunce
{b}eware of foly / beware of inwarde pryde
clymbe not to fast / but yet fortune abyde
for your loue i thanke you / yf trouthe haue it fyxte
as with yll thought / neuer for to be myxte
[p] amour.
surely my mynde / nor yet my purpose
in ony cause by foly dyde vary
neuer doynge thynke open ne close
that to your honour sholde be contrary
as yet for grace i am content to tary
for myn enmyes fraude and subtylnes
whiche pryuely begyne theyr owne vnhapynesse
[p] pucell.
now of trouthe / i do vnto you tell
the thynge [that] to your enmyes is moost dyspleasure
is for to gouerne you by wysdome ryght well
that causeth enuy in theyr hertes to endure
but be ye pacyent and ye shall be sure
suche thynges as the ordayne vnto your gref
wyll lyght on them to theyr owne myschefe
[p] amour.
surely i thynke / i suffred well the phyppe
the nette also dydde teche me on the waye
but me to bere i trowe they lost a lyppe
for the lyfte hande extendyd my iournaye
and not to call me for my sporte and playe
wherfore by foly yf that they do synne
the holy goost maye well the batayle wynne
[p] pucell.
yf fortune wolde / for the payne ye haue taken
i wolde gra[un]t you loue / but it may noth[yn]ge a{uayle}
my loue is past / it can not be forsaken
therfore i praye you leue your trauayle
full lothe i were / your deth to bewayle
there is no nette / nor no tempted snare
but ye them knowe / wherfore ye maye beware
[p] amour.
the snares and nettes / set in sondrye maner
doone in tyme past / made many a byrde a dawe
the tempted gynnes / were sette so cyrculer
but euermore it is an olde sayd sawe
examples past dooth theche one to withdrawe
frome all suche perylles / wherfore than maye i
by grace of god / beware full parfytly
[p] pucell.
ye saye the trouthe / and i do not submytte
my wyll and thought to the lady venus
as she is goddesse / and doth true loue knytte
ryght so to determyne / the mater betwene vs
with assent of fortune / so good gracyous
besechynge you now for to holde you styll
for these two ladyes / maye your mynde fulfyll
[p] amour.
my ryght dere lady / i do therto consente
swete are your wordes they confort my thought
of venus and fortune / i abyde the iugement
but ryght dere lady / whome i longe haue sought
forgete me not / remembre loue dere bought
