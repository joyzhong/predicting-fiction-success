ode pour selection de son sepulchre
for three years, out of key with his time,
he strove to resuscitate the dead art
of poetry; to maintain "the sublime"
in the old sense. wrong from the start--
no hardly, but, seeing he had been born
in a half savage country, out of date;
bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn;
capaneus; trout for factitious bait;

caught in the unstopped ear;
giving the rocks small lee-way
the chopped seas held him, therefore, that year.
his true penelope was flaubert,
he fished by obstinate isles;
observed the elegance of circe's hair
rather than the mottoes on sun-dials.
unaffected by "the march of events,"
he passed from men's memory in _l'an trentiesme
de son eage_; the case presents
no adjunct to the muses' diadem.

the age demanded an image
of its accelerated grimace,
something for the modern stage,
not, at any rate, an attic grace;
not, not certainly, the obscure reveries
of the inward gaze;
better mendacities
than the classics in paraphrase!
the "age demanded" chiefly a mould in plaster,
made with no loss of time,
a prose kinema, not, not assuredly, alabaster
or the "sculpture" of rhyme.

believing in old men's lies, then unbelieving

there died a myriad,
and of the best, among them,
for an old bitch gone in the teeth,
for a botched civilization,

quick eyes gone under earth's lid,
for two gross of broken statues,
for a few thousand battered books.

gladstone was still respected,
when john ruskin produced
"kings treasuries"; swinburne
and rossetti still abused.
foetid buchanan lifted up his voice
when that faun's head of hers
became a pastime for
painters and adulterers.
the burne-jones cartons
have preserved her eyes;
still, at the tate, they teach
cophetua to rhapsodize;
thin like brook-water,
with a vacant gaze.
the english rubaiyat was still-born
in those days.
the thin, clear gaze, the same
still darts out faun-like from the half-ruin'd fac
questing and passive ....
"ah, poor jenny's case"...
bewildered that a world
shows no surprise
at her last maquero's
adulteries.

among the pickled foetuses and bottled bones,
engaged in perfecting the catalogue,
i found the last scion of the
senatorial families of strasbourg, monsieur verog.
for two hours he talked of gallifet;
of dowson; of the rhymers' club;
told me how johnson (lionel) died
by falling from a high stool in a pub . . .
but showed no trace of alcohol
at the autopsy, privately performed--
tissue preserved--the pure mind
arose toward newman as the whiskey warmed.
dowson found harlots cheaper than hotels;
headlam for uplift; image impartially imbued
with raptures for bacchus, terpsichore and the church.
so spoke the author of "the dorian mood",
m. verog, out of step with the decade,
detached from his contemporaries,
neglected by the young,
because of these reveries.

the sky-like limpid eyes,
the circular infant's face,
the stiffness from spats to collar
never relaxing into grace;
the heavy memories of horeb, sinai and the forty years,
showed only when the daylight fell
level across the face
of brennbaum "the impeccable".

likewise a friend of bloughram's once advised me:

beneath the sagging roof
the stylist has taken shelter,
unpaid, uncelebrated,
at last from the world's welter
nature receives him,
with a placid and uneducated mistress
he exercises his talents

leaks through its thatch;
he offers succulent cooking;
the door has a creaking latch.

"daphne with her thighs in bark
stretches toward me her leafy hands",--
subjectively. in the stuffed-satin drawing-room
i await the lady valentine's commands,
knowing my coat has never been
of precisely the fashion
to stimulate, in her,
a durable passion;
doubtful, somewhat, of the value
of well-gowned approbation
of literary effort,
but never of the lady valentine's vocation:
poetry, her border of ideas,
the edge, uncertain, but a means of blending
with other strata
where the lower and higher have ending;
a hook to catch the lady jane's attention,
a modulation toward the theatre,
also, in the case of revolution,
a possible friend and comforter.

go, dumb-born book,
tell her that sang me once that song of lawes;
hadst thou but song
as thou hast subjects known,
then were there cause in thee that should condone
even my faults that heavy upon me lie
and build her glories their longevity.
tell her that sheds
such treasure in the air,
recking naught else but that her graces give
life to the moment,
i would bid them live
as roses might, in magic amber laid,
red overwrought with orange and all made
one substance and one colour
braving time.
tell her that goes
with song upon her lips
but sings not out the song, nor knows
the maker of it, some other mouth,
may be as fair as hers,
might, in new ages, gain her worshippers,
when our two dusts with waller's shall be laid,
siftings on siftings in oblivion,
till change hath broken down
all things save beauty alone.

unable in the supervening blankness

ultimately, his seismograph:
--given, that is, his urge
to convey the relation
of eye-lid and cheek-bone

to present the series
of curious heads in medallion--
he had passed, inconscient, full gaze,
the wide-banded irises

in their diastasis;
which anaesthesis, noted a year late,
and weighed, revealed his great affect,

of eros, a retrospect.

resistance to current exacerbations
