even if somebody did steal
my battery, generator, oil cap,
visegrips last night,
i passed the test to be a taxi driver,
and even if i don't have the money
to buy a _charley's taxi_ shirt,
congratulations to me.
i'll figure something out.
i'll have coffee in _everybody's bake shop; _
i'll write varve and finn,

peter's answer
little blue heron, young, still white,
by the north causeway bridge--
stick legs, too thin
for the swelling body,
the visual weight of feathers,
stepping slowly in shallow water,
long toes trailing limply, then
extending, three splayed forward,
one back. brilliant neck
curving, poised. dagger beak
the same gray as legs and toes.
why is nature beautiful?
the lust for pattern, peter said.
the heron's head rose and twisted,
circular eye, light brown, orange
rimmed, ancient intelligence
asking a different question.
i was unmoving, not dangerous.
the heron turned to hunt,
brush, a cloud above the river.

billy frailly's got a new shirt,
shaved and walking down the road
ready for anything.
when i was in fifth grade
billy powered his bike up church hill
(black stetson, yellow kerchief).
i helped him shovel out mrs. cowell's
parking place. he did most of the work,
but he split the money fifty-fifty.
he's an outcast now;
no frontier he can reach.
but he's not crying, and we know
there is no virtue, only consequence
and the sometimes music
of a new shirt.

drove over the bridge today,
saw the water far below

your last jump--

you always told me to tell.
you sure as hell saved my life.

i miss you. i wish
you could have played with finnegan.

i think of you drinking, dancing,
unable to sleep, reading until first light,
a blanket drawn around your shoulders,
afternoons, working your wheel until
the time to mingle with true hearts,
raise glasses, hug, laugh,
help as you can.
we are all dying, slower or faster,
but it hurts to watch.
and out of the numb exuberant wreckage of your days
come these raku pots--
graceful open shapes, lines freely
scratched into the clay, deep turquoise,
copper glazes, extravagant, surprised,
too beautiful for tears.

shifting unstable air,

raindrops standing on
the candy red gas tank

tach speedometer needles
resting on their zero pegs,
